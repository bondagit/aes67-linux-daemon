# Introduction

The daemon is a Linux process that uses the [Merging Technologies ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 Driver](https://bitbucket.org/MergingTechnologies/ravenna-alsa-lkm/src/master) to handle PTP synchronization and RTP streams and exposes a REST interface for configuration and status monitoring.

The **ALSA AES67 Driver** implements a virtual ALSA audio device that can be configured using _Sources_ and _Sinks_ and it's clocked using the PTP clock.
A _Source_ reads audio samples from the ALSA playback device and sends RTP packets to a configured multicast or unicast address.
A _Sink_ receives RTP packets from a specific multicast or unicast address and writes them to the ALSA capture device.

A user can use the ALSA capture device to receive synchronized incoming audio samples from an RTP stream and the ALSA playback device to send synchronized audio samples to an RTP stream.
The binding between a _Source_ and the ALSA playback device is determined by the channels used during the playback and the configured _Source_ channels map. The binding between a _Sink_ and the ALSA capture device is determined by the channels used while recoding and the configured _Sink_ channels map.

The driver handles the PTP and RTP packets processing and acts as a PTP clock slave to synchronize with a master clock on the specified PTP domain.  All the configured _Sources_ and _Sinks_ are synchronized using the same PTP clock.

The daemon communicates with the driver for control, configuration and status monitoring only by using _netlink_ sockets.
The daemon implements a REST interface to configure and monitor the _Sources_, the _Sinks_ and PTP slave. See [README](daemon/README.md) for additional info.
It also implements SAP sources discovery and advertisement compatible with AES67 standard and mDNS sources discovery and advertisement compatible with Ravenna standard.

A WebUI is provided to allow daemon and driver configuration and monitoring. The WebUI uses the daemon REST API and exposes all the supported configuration paramaters for the daemon, the PTP slave clock, the _Sources_ and the _Sinks_. The WebUI can also be used to monitor the PTP slave status and the _Sinks_ status and to browse the remote SAP and mDNS sources.

* Freeware Advanced Audio Coder (if streamer enabled) libfaac >= 1.30

The following platforms have been used for testing:

A NanoPi NEO2 with Allwinner H5 Quad-core 64-bit Cortex A53 processor.
See [Armbian NanoPi NEO2 ](https://www.armbian.com/nanopi-neo-2/) for additional information about how to setup Ubuntu on this board.

A Mini PC N40 with Intel® Celeron® Processor N4020 , 2 Cores/2 Threads (4M Cache, up to 2.80 GHz).
See [Minisforum N40 Mini PC](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-n40-mini-pc) and [how to Install Ubuntu on a fanless Mini PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2djTPJ02xK0).

The [ubuntu-packages.sh](ubuntu-packages.sh) script can be used to install all the packages required to compile and run the AES67 daemon, and the [platform compatibility test](#test).

**_Important_** CPU scaling events could affect daemon streams causing unexpected distortions, see [CPU scaling events and scripts notes](#notes).

**_Important_** Starting from Linux kernel 5.10.x onwards a change in a kernel parameter is required to fix a problem with round robin scheduler causing the latency test to fail, see [Real Time Scheduler Throttling](#notes).

**_Important_** _PulseAudio_ must be disabled or uninstalled for the daemon to work properly, see [PulseAudio and scripts notes](#notes).

## How to build and setup the daemon ##
Install on your target machine (both ARM or X86) an Ubuntu Linux distribution. **NO Virtual machines**. 
The daemon should work on all Ubuntu starting from 18.04 onward, it's possible to use other distros.

* Install all the required packages by running the script [ubuntu-packages.sh](ubuntu-packages.sh)
* execute the [build.sh](build.sh) script to download and build the driver, the daemon and the WebUI, see [script notes](#notes).
  The script performs the following operations:
  * checkout, patch and build the Merging Technologies ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module
  * checkout the cpp-httplib
  * build and deploy the WebUI
  * build the AES67 daemon

* edit the daemon configuration file _daemon/daemon.conf_ and change the _interface_name_ parameter to the ethernet network interface you want to use. Ex: _eth0_
* install the driver by executing from the main folder:

      (cd 3rdparty/ravenna-alsa-lkm/driver && sudo insmod ./MergingRavennaALSA.ko)

* start the daemon by executing from the main folder:

      cd daemon
      ./aes67-daemon -c daemon.conf

* use the daemon option _-a_ if you want to bind the daemon HTTP server to another address. For example _-a 0.0.0.0_ to bind the daemon HTTP server to all the local network interfaces.
* open a browser and load the daemon configuration WebUI at http://[your_ip]:8080
* on the WebUI use the Browser tab to see the other ASE67 Sources advertised on the network.
* on the WebUI use the Sinks tab to create a receiver by specifying a remote Source manually or by selecting one of the remote Source discovered (check the Use SDP option to enable this).
* on the WebUI use the Sources tab to create a daemon source
* on the WebUI use the PTP tab to check the status of the daemon PTP slave. Receiving or sending audio via the ALSA RAVENNA device is only possible if the PTP slave status is locked.
* playback on the RAVENNA ALSA device to send audio via a Source, for example for a stereo source use:

      speaker-test -D plughw:RAVENNA -r 48000 -c 2 -t sine
* record from the RAVENNA ALSA device to receive audio via a Sink, for example to record to a file a stereo sink use:

      arecord -D plughw:RAVENNA -c 2 -f cd -d 30 -r 48000 -t wav sink.wav
* to run interoperability tests with other AES67 devices, for example with Dante devices use instructions below.

## Devices and interoperability tests ##
See [Devices and interoperability tests with the AES67 daemon](DEVICES.md)

## HTTP Streamer ##
The HTTP Streamer was introduced with the daemon version 2.0 and it is used to receive AES67 audio streams via HTTP file streaming.

The HTTP Streamer can be enabled via the _streamer_enabled_ daemon parameter.
When the Streamer is active the daemon starts capturing the configured _Sinks_ up to the maximum number of channels configured by the _streamer_channels_ parameter.
The captured PCM samples are split into _streamer_files_num_ files of _streamer_file_duration_ duration (in seconds) for each sink, compressed using AAC LC codec and served via HTTP.
![Screenshot 2024-06-15 at 15 36 48](https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon/assets/56439183/3341b05e-daed-4541-b0a1-28839d5b9a6b)
The HTTP streamer requires the libfaac-dev package to compile.

Please note that since the HTTP Streamer uses the RAVENNA ALSA device for capturing it's not possible to use such device for other audio captures.

## Transcription ##
The support for audio transcription was introduced with the daemon version 3.0 and it is used for real-time speech to text conversion.

The transcription can be enabled via the _transcriber_enabled_ daemon parameter.
When the Transcriber is active the daemon starts capturing the configured _Sinks_ up to the maximum number of channels configured by the _transcriber_channels_ parameter and perform speech to text for all the configured _Sinks_.

See [ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 Driver README](https://bitbucket.org/MergingTechnologies/ravenna-alsa-lkm/src/master/README.md) for additional information about the Merging Technologies module and for proper Linux Kernel configuration and tuning.

### [systemd](systemd) directory ###

This directory contains systemd configuration files for the daemon.

The daemon integrates with systemd watchdog.

To enable it recompile the daemon with the CMake option _-DWITH_SYSTEMD=ON_

You can install the daemon under _systemd_ by using the script [systemd/install.sh](systemd/install.sh):

    cd systemd
    sudo ./install.sh

Before starting the daemon edit _/etc/daemon.conf_ and make sure the _interface_name_ parameter is set to your ethernet interface.

To start the daemon use:

     sudo systemctl start aes67-daemon

To stop it use:

     sudo systemctl stop aes67-daemon


The daemon requires the _MergingRavennaALSA_ module to run.

You can usally install the module using the following commands:

    cd 3rdparty/ravenna-alsa-lkm/driver
    sudo make modules_install

If this doesn't work because you miss kernel certificate follow the instructions at: 
[No OpenSSL sign-file signing_key.pem](https://superuser.com/questions/1214116/no-openssl-sign-file-signing-key-pem-leads-to-error-while-loading-kernel-modules)

Finally use the command to load the modules:

    sudo depmod -a


### [test](test) directory ###

This directory contains the files used to run the daemon platform compatibility test on the network loopback interface. The [test](#test) is described below.

## Run the platform compatibility test ##
<a name="test"></a>
Before attempting to use the AES67 daemon on a specific host or board it's highly recommended to run the platform test.
The platform test runs a playback and recording of an RTP session on the loopback network device using the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 modules and checks that no audio samples get corrupted or lost.
This test can be executed using the [run\_test.sh](run_test.sh) script. See [script notes](#notes).

The script allows a user to test a specific configuration and it can be used to ensure that the daemon will be able to operate smoothly with such config on the current platform.

      Usage run_test.sh sample_format sample_rate channels duration
           sample_format can be one of S16_LE, S24_3LE, S32_LE
           sample_rate can be one of 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000, 192000, 384000
           channels can be one of 2, 4, 6, up to 64
           duration is in the range 1 to 10 minutes

For example to test the typical AES67 configuration run:

      ./run_test.sh S24_3LE 48000 2 5

The test performs the following operations:

* check that all the required executables are available
* stop the running daemon instances and remove the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module
* compile the test tools under the test folder
* validates the input parameters, prepare the raw input file to be played *./test/test.raw* and the configuration files under the test folder
* stop PulseAudio (if installed). This opens and keeps busy the ALSA playback and capture devices causing problems. See [PulseAudio](#notes).
* install the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 module
* start the ptp4l as master clock on the network loopback interface
* start the AES67 daemon and create a source and a sink according to the status file created in the test directory
* wait for the Ravenna driver PTP slave to synchronize
* start recording on the configured ALSA sink for the specified period tof time to the raw file *./test/sink_test.raw*
* start playing the test file created *./test/test.raw* on the configured ALSA source
* wait for the recording and the playback to complete
* check that the recorded file contains the expected audio samples sequence
* terminate ptp4l and the AES67 daemon
* print the test result that can be either *OK* or *failed at (location)*


If the test result is OK it means that the selected configuration can run smoothly on your platform.

A 64 channels configuration was succesfully tested on the _Mini PC_ with Intel Celeron N4020 processor.

A 24 channels configuration was succesfully tested on the _NanoPi NEO2 board_.

If the test reports a failure you may try to stop all the possible additional loads running on the host and repeat it.
If after this the test fails systematically it means you cannot achieve a good reliability with the specified configuration.
In this case you may try to configure a different driver timer basic tick period in the daemon configuration file (parameter *tic\_frame\_size\_at\_1fs* in *test/daemon.conf*).
By default this parameter is set to 48 (1ms latency) and the valid range is from 48 to 480 with steps of 48.
Note that higher values of this parameter (values above 48) lead to higher packets processing latency and this breaks the compatibility with certain devices.

## Run the platform latency test ##
<a name="latency"></a>
The platform latency test can be used to measure the minimum end-to-end latency that can be achieved on a specific platform.

The test is based on the same setup used for the platform compatibility test where a _Sink_ is configured to receive audio samples from a _Source_
 both running on the same device using the network loopback interface.
 
A test application plays audio samples on the RAVENNA playback device and measures the time till the samples are received on the RAVENNA capture device.

The test setup and the end-to-end latency measured are shown in the picture below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56439183/144990290-c5c94697-b631-4af0-981a-dfea5fc21e9a.png)

The test can be executed using the [run\_latency\_test.sh](run_latency_test.sh) script. See [script notes](#notes).

The script allows a user to test the latency on a specific configuration and it can be used to ensure that a specific ALSA buffer size can be used:

      Usage run_latency_test.sh sample_format sample_rate channels duration frames
           sample_format can be one of S16_LE, S24_3LE, S32_LE
           sample_rate can be one of 44100, 48000, 88200, 96000, 192000, 384000
           channels can be one of 2, 4, 6, up to 64
           duration of the test in seconds
           frames buffer size in frames

The specified buffer size in frames starts from _tic_frame_size_at_1fs_ * 2 (96 by default) in steps of _tic_frame_size_at_1fs_.

For example, to test the typical AES67 configuration for 1 minute and a buffer size of 96 frames run:

      ./run_latency_test.sh S24_3LE 48000 2 60 96
      
If no underrun errors occurred during the test the requested buffer size can be used and the end-to-end latency measured is printed at the end:

      Trying latency 96 frames, 2000.000us, 2.000000ms (500.0000Hz)
      Success
      Playback:

      End to end latency: 5.999 msecs
      Terminating processes ...
      daemon exiting with code: 0

The previous test was run on a _NanoPi NEO2 board_ with Ubuntu distro.

A 64 channels configuration was succesfully tested on the _Mini PC_ with Intel Celeron N4020 processor.

A 24 channels configuration was succesfully tested on the _NanoPi NEO2 board_.

In case underrun happened the status reported is:

         state       : XRUN
      
and the specified buffer size cannot be used.

**_Important_** Starting from Linux kernel 5.10.x onwards a change in a kernel parameter is required to fix a problem with round robin scheduler causing the latency test to fail, see [Real Time Scheduler Throttling](#notes).

## Run the daemon tests ##
To run daemon tests install the ALSA RAVENNA/AES67 kernel module with:

      sudo insmod 3rdparty/ravenna-alsa-lkm/driver/MergingRavennaALSA.ko

setup the kernel parameters with:

      sudo sysctl -w net/ipv4/igmp_max_memberships=66

make sure that no instances of the aes67-daemon are running, enter the [tests](daemon/tests) subdirectory and run:

      ./daemon-test -p

## Notes ##
<a name="notes"></a>

* All the scripts in this repository are provided as a reference to help setting up the system and run the platform compatibility test.
  They have been tested starting from **Ubuntu 18.04** distros onwards.
* Starting from Linux kernel 5.10.x onwards a change in a kernel parameter is required to fix a problem with round robin scheduler causing the latency test to fail, see [issue 79](https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon/issues/96) and alsa-lib [issue-285](https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib/issues/285).

  Set the total bandwidth available to all real-time tasks to 100% of the CPU with:

      sysctl -w kernel.sched_rt_runtime_us=1000000

  By default this value is set to 95%.

* CPU scaling events could have an impact on daemon streams causing unexpected distortion for a few seconds, see [issue 96](https://github.com/bondagit/aes67-linux-daemon/issues/96).
Before running the daemon make sure you disable CPU scaling events:

  Check if CPU scaling is enabled with:

      cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_cpu_time_max_percent

  If result is not 0, (it's usually set to 25) set it to 0 with:

      sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_cpu_time_max_percent=0

  You may also want to review the current CPU scaling governor with (cpu0 in this case):

      cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt for dditional info.
* **PulseAudio** can create instability problems.
Before running the daemon verify that PulseAudio is not running with:

      ps ax | grep pulseaudio

  In case it's running try to execute the following script to stop it:

      daemon/scripts/disable_pulseaudio.sh

  If after this the process is still alive consider one of these two solutions and reboot the system afterwards:
  * Uninstall it completely with:

        sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio

  * Disable it by renaming the executable with:

         sudo mv /usr/bin/pulseaudio /usr/bin/_pulseaudio

  Other methods to disable PulseAudio may fail and just killing it is not enough since it gets immediately re-spawned.
